"""
An exercise that implements the "Acrobats" role-playing exercise.
See    m3_acrobats   for details.

This is the   DoublingAcrobat   class in that exercise.
  -- A DoublingAcrobat can clap, twirl and count, like a BasicAcrobat,
     but each time she claps or twirls, she does so TWICE as many
     times as requested.  Her  count  function returns the number
     of operations that she has done (thus twice the number requested).
