"""
An exercise that implements the "Acrobats" role-playing exercise.
See    m3_acrobats   for details.

This is the   Choreographer   class in that exercise.
  -- When a Choreographer is asked to clap or twirl, she chooses two
     Acrobats at random, and asks THEM to clap or twirl the requested
     number of times.  If she is asked to count, she picks two Acrobats
     at random, asks them to count, and returns the sum of the values
     that they return.
     Her random choices can be any Acrobats, including herself.
